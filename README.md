<h1>Introducion 📝</h1>

Discord bot written in c# using <a href="https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus">DSharp+</a>.
It's main function is to search signs in asl, and replies with a video of the sign.

The videos are taken from https://www.signingsavvy.com/ if you use the !asl command. There are other commands for other pages, but are not
fully implemented.

<h1>Commands 👌</h1>

All commands must be preceded by '!'
